Guide to Reproducing the Fractal Lattice Generation and Conversion

1. Understanding the Fractal Lattice Structure:

   - Hexagonal Lattice Basics: 
     - A hexagonal lattice consists of points arranged in a pattern where each point is surrounded by six others, forming hexagons.
     - Each point can be represented by Cartesian coordinates (x, y) calculated using trigonometric functions.

   - Fractal Structure:
     - The fractal is generated by recursively adding scaled copies of the hexagonal lattice.
     - Each iteration involves scaling the previous lattice by a factor of 3 and adding new points at specific offsets.

2. Generating the Initial Hexagonal Lattice:

   - Step 1: Create a set of points representing the vertices of a regular hexagon.
     - Use trigonometric functions to compute the x and y coordinates for each of the six vertices.
     - These coordinates are based on the angles 0, π/3, 2π/3, ... for x = cos(angle) and y = sin(angle).

   - Step 2: Define the base case for recursion, which consists of these six points forming the initial hexagon.

3. Recursive Fractal Construction:

   - Step 1: For each level of iteration, scale the previous set of lattice points by a factor of 3.
   
   - Step 2: For each point in the scaled lattice, generate new points by translating the scaled hexagon centers along the directions determined by the angles 0, π/3, 2π/3, ...

   - Step 3: Continue the process until the desired number of iterations is reached, forming a fractal lattice structure.

4. Conversion to Integer Arrays:

   - Step 1: Once the fractal lattice points are generated, round the coordinates to the nearest integer to create grid points on a 2D array.
     - Scale the x coordinates by a factor of 2 to account for the hexagonal grid's spacing.
     - Adjust the y coordinates by scaling them by a factor of 2/√3.

   - Step 2: Populate a 2D integer array where the indices correspond to the integer coordinates of the lattice points.
     - Set the value to 1 at positions corresponding to the presence of a lattice point and 0 otherwise.

5. Pristine Lattice Construction:

   - Step 1: Independently construct a pristine lattice structure by repeating a small template of the lattice across a larger array.
     - The pristine lattice is constructed without recursion, using predefined repeating units.

   - Step 2: Construct this lattice by placing a small template repeatedly across the array, reducing the number of pieces placed with each subsequent layer.

   - Step 3: Reflect this array vertically and combine it with its original form to create a symmetrical lattice structure.

6. Converting Integer Arrays to Coordinates:

   - Step 1: Extract the indices of non-zero values from the 2D integer arrays (created in the previous steps).
   
   - Step 2: Convert these indices back into Cartesian coordinates.
     - Reverse the previous scaling of x and y to retrieve the original coordinates.
     - Center the coordinates by subtracting half of the maximum range in both x and y directions.
